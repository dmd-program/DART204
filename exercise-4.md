### Exercise 4 - Typography Animation

**Typography animation** (sometimes referred to as kinetic typography) is a kind of animation that depends heavily on the audio it uses as a base.

For this exercise you will pick a line from a video of your choice, and you will create an animation based on that line. Make sure that your animation syncs with the audio, and that it represents the central idea of the line you picked.

Some examples of typography animation for inspiration:

These animations can be simple:
