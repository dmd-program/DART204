# Unit 1

## Introduction to Animation and Animation Principles

### Overview

In Unit 1 we will talk about the history of animation, the rules for creating a great story, and the initial stages for the animation production process. We will also discuss the principles that apply to all kinds of animation, from hand drawn to computer generated. These principles are the base to understand what animation is made of, and how it can bring even simple shapes like a rectangle or a circle to life. This unit will also give you an understanding of the differences between good and bad animation, so you can apply good practices to create more engaging and thoughtful animations of your own. Throughout the unit you will work on hands-on animation exercises, which will be the foundation of every animated work you create from then on, and you will take the first steps towards your final animation project. At the end of this unit you will have learned and exercised the basic principles of animation and the art of storytelling.
