### Lesson 5 - Graph editor, audio and timing

In this lesson we will go deeper into digital animation properties using After Effects. We will discuss how we can use animation principles and the graph editor to create more compelling animations. You will also learn about the importance of audio as a valuable tool to tell your story. At the end of this lesson you will create an animated representation of a song/audio sample in After Effects using simple shapes and text.
