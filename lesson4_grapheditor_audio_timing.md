### Lesson 5 - Graph editor, audio and timing

In this lessons we will go a little bit more in depth into the animation properties in After Effects, as well as how we can use animation principles and the graph editor to tweak our animations and the importance of audio in motion design.

Let’s start by looking at the example animation from our last lesson:

This animation has almost all of the elements of motion design, but it is far from complete. The movement of each element is very linear and unappealing, and the animation lacks personality and weight.

The way we fix this is by remembering our first lesson, and making use of the always very important **Animation Principles**. Not all animation principles apply to motion design, but most of them can be used in all kinds of animation. The most commonly used animation principle in motion design is **ease in and ease out**. We have already seen how this principle works in frame by frame 2D animation, so let’s take a look at how it works inside After Effects and how we can apply it in our logo animation.
