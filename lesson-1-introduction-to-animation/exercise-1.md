# Exercise 1 - Short Story

In this exercise, you will be creating a short story. This story will help you to begin envisioning themes and a direction for your final project on this course. This will also serve as a source of inspiration and a guide for future projects.

## Guidelines

Write a short story with the theme "journey". A journey is series of situations, beginning, middle and end, that generally depict growth or change to the main character, be it a hero on an epic adventure or a square shape that transforms into a circle. Keep your story simple and direct.

## Steps to Completion

####1.An easy way to start is by following Pixar's storytelling tip #4:

Once upon a time there was ----.
Every day, ----.
One day ----.
Because of that, ----.
Because of that, ----.
Until finally ----.

####2.Expand on this initial set of ideas and rewrite your story clearly separated in three acts.

**Beginning:** The introduction of characters, their initial situation and their goals.
**Middle:** The situation changes and obstacles appear (crisis).
**End:** The obstacles are overcome (climax). The characters, now changed by their journey, achieve their goals, sometimes at a price.

####3. Expand and rewrite, one more time.

By rewriting your story you will get a chance to deepen your understanding of your own characters and their objectives, and refine your story to be more clear and relatable.

####4. Post your final story as a PDF file to the course page following this naming convention:
