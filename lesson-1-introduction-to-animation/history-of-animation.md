## Lesson 1: Introduction


Animation can be generally defined as the act of creating an illusion of movement through the use of still images played in a sequence. In this lesson you will learn about the history of animation, exploring the evolution of early animation devices into modern animation techniques.

###A brief history of animation

Images in motion were depicted as early as humans started recording their experiences through painting in paleolithic times. Drawings, carvings, and sculptures portraying human and animal activity in motion can be found in the walls of caves, utensils such as pottery, and even built structures. In the beginning of the 19th century a series of devices started to emerge, setting the stage for modern animation techniques. **Some of these early animation devices are:**

####1820s - Thaumatrope 
The thaumatrope was invented in the 1820s and consists of a disk with an image on each side 
connected to two pieces of string. Turning the strings between the fingers caused the image to spin, creating the illusion that both images are one.

####1831 - Phenakistoscope 
The phenakistoscope, invented in 1831, was a disk containing several still images depicting a sequence in motion. The disk was attached to a handle and contained equally spaced slits through which the user could see the spinning images. The phenakistoscope is often compared to modern gif images, because it shows a sequence of images playing on a loop.

####1834 - Zoetrope 
Similar to the phenakistoscope, the zoetrope also presents a sequence of spinning images that create the illusion of motion. Rather than placed on a flat disk, however, in the zoetrope the images are distributed on the wall of a cylinder with equally spaced slits through which the animation can be viewed. Different from the phenakistoscope that can be experienced only by one person at a time, the zoetrope allows for several users to enjoy the experience.
