##Storytelling and Pre-production

###Storytelling

Think about your favorite animated movie. What was the movie about? What was the main character's name? How did that movie make you feel?

Chances are, if you have a favorite animated movie, you remember the story by heart, the character's names and what they are like (funny, grumpy, quirky, smart). Depending on the movie, you might know the lyrics of the songs the characters sing, and you definitely remember how that movie made you feel. You may get emotional just thinking about a sad scene, because you care about those characters and what they have gone through. That is why story is the most important aspect of an animation.

You may create the most technically stunning animation you are capable of, but if you don't have an interesting story behind it, it probably won't engage the viewer. Animation, as any other art form, needs to be imbued with meaning, even if this meaning is not instantly noticeable.

So how do you write a meaningful story? There is no short answer to that, but a good start is to think about **your own experiences in life and important memories you have**. Some memories may be sad, or you might remember something that taught you an important lesson. If you remember it vividly, this might be a good start for a story. Don't confuse this with the idea that every story you write is specifically about you. What you want to focus on is the feeling you get, the emotion you feel when you remember something, and **how you translate that feeling into a story**. Also very important is how you transfer that emotion to other people. Make sure your story is **relatable**, and that other people understand what you are trying to convey.

Try to **keep your story simple**, at least at first. Once you have a general idea of what your story is about, try to plan ahead and think how it all starts, and how it will end. This might help you to keep a clear goal and not get sidetracked. This doesn't mean that you can't change your mind though. **Stories change and evolve constantly** while you create them, so don't feel pressured to work on an idea just because it looked really good in the past, and don't be afraid of starting over.

Writing doesn't have to be a lonely process. Look for other people's opinions and pay attention to their reaction to your story. Take all criticism and praise into account, but make sure to stay true to your vision. Remember this is your story and you are free to tell it any way you like it.

Finally, as you write your story, try to imagine it as a movie/animation. Ask yourself how does it translate to the screen, what do the characters and locations look like, and how does that affect the story itself. This will make the process of turning your story into an animation later on much easier.

- how to create a storyboard

    - make it clear and quickly understandable
    - image composition
    - scene descriptions
    - use of arrows to depict moving characters/cameras
