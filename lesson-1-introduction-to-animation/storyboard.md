##Storytelling and Pre-production

###Storytelling

Think about your favorite animated movie. What was the movie about? What was the main character's name? How did that movie make you feel?

Chances are, if you have a favorite animated movie, you remember the story by heart, the character's names and what they are like (funny, grumpy, quirky, smart). Depending on the movie, you might know the lyrics of the songs the characters sing, and you definitely remember how that movie made you feel. You may get emotional just thinking about a sad scene, because you care about those characters and what they have gone through. That is why story is the most important aspect of an animation.

You may create the most technically stunning animation you are capable of, but if you don't have an interesting story behind it, it probably won't engage the viewer. Animation, as any other art form, needs to be imbued with meaning, even if this meaning is not instantly noticeable.

So how do you write a meaningful story? There is no short answer to that, but a good start is to think about **your own experiences in life and important memories you have**. Some memories may be sad, or you might remember something that taught you an important lesson. If you remember it vividly, this might be a good start for a story. Don't confuse this with the idea that every story you write is specifically about you. What you want to focus on is the feeling you get, the emotion you feel when you remember something, and **how you translate that feeling into a story**. Also very important is how you transfer that emotion to other people. Make sure your story is **relatable**, and that other people understand what you are trying to convey.

Try to **keep your story simple**, at least at first. Once you have a general idea of what your story is about, try to plan ahead and think how it all starts, and how it will end. This might help you to keep a clear goal and not get sidetracked. This doesn't mean that you can't change your mind though. **Stories change and evolve constantly** while you create them, so don't feel pressured to work on an idea just because it looked really good in the past, and don't be afraid of starting over.

Writing doesn't have to be a lonely process. Look for other people's opinions and pay attention to their reaction to your story. Take all criticism and praise into account, but make sure to stay true to your vision. Remember this is your story and you are free to tell it any way you like it.

Finally, as you write your story, try to imagine it as a movie/animation. Ask yourself how does it translate to the screen, what do the characters and locations look like, and how does that affect the story itself. This will make the process of turning your story into an animation later on much easier.

### Pre-production


As in film, pre-production in animation is the planning period before any development is done. It is in this phase that your ideas and animation take shape as you better define characters, locations, story and as many other details as you can.

The first step of pre-production is called **outline**. The outline is a document where you collect and organize all the elements of your story. This is a very important step in animation development, and very useful to not lose sight of the details about the plot, characters, etcetera.

An outline can have many forms. It can be a simple list or a collection of images, text and even sounds. It depends on what works better for you as an animator.

- what is pre-production in animation (animation outlines, character profiles)

- what are storyboards and their importance

- how to create a storyboard

    - make it clear and quickly understandable
    - image composition
    - scene descriptions
    - use of arrows to depict moving characters/cameras
```

For pre-production:
You need a outline/show bible and a final draft script.

You need character, location and prop designs. Pose sheets of the same, plus turnarounds and expression sheets. Mouth charts are needed too if you have dialogue, this is for all speaking characters.
Locations would need at least two views, and props would need images showing their functions, if specific. You'd also need size comparisons as well.
Any special effects animation should have its styling designed at this point as well, so that layout can take its cues from the style.
You also need complete colour models/ colour guide done for all 4 categories. Digital colour will need precise colour chips or palette for painting the animation.
The idea is to idiot-proof the material so that anyone can understand what characters look like, how they generally move, what their general expressions and etotions are, what the settings are, and how props work and are used.

Voice track should be recorded at this point.

Then you need storyboards done for the entire 10 minutes.
Storyboards need all scenes numbered, re-used cited, camera directions shown and labelled, and dialogue labelled.

Then the 'board needs to be slugged (timed out per the entire show, and per scene), and then an animatic shot.
Then the slugging needs to be broken down into sheet timing for the exposure sheets--based on the voice track, and then layout of the individual scenes begun.
Layout must supply key poses and timing charts fo the animation, including any breakdowns of the secondary actions and major inbetweens. Also should have mouth charts and all major lip-synch posed out, so that animation should essentially just use the provided moths and poses.
Layouts can be medium rough-but a sample clean drawing should be provided in every scene to give animation an idea of the line quality called for.

While Layout is commencing, background painting should be undertaken.

This so that all the studio has to do is supply animation key poses, clean-up and in betweens--and whatever post-production services they agree to.
