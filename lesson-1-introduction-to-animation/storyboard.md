##Storytelling and Pre-production

###Storytelling

- **importance of storytelling in animation**

Think about your favorite animated movie. What was the movie about? What was the main character's name? How did that movie make you feel?

Chances are, if you have a favorite animated movie, you remember the story by heart, the character's names and what they are like (funny, grumpy, quirky, smart). Depending on the movie, you might know the lyrics of the songs the characters sing, and you definitely remember how that movie made you feel. You may get emotional just thinking about a sad scene, because you care about those characters and what they have gone through. That is why story is the most important aspect of an animation.

You may create the most technically stunning animation you are capable of, but if you don't have an interesting story behind it, it probably won't engage the viewer. Animation, as any other art form, needs to be imbued with meaning, even if this meaning is not instantly noticeable.

- **how to create a story (make it personal, engage people, be honest, plan ahead, don't self-criticize/let your ideas evolve and change, don't be afraid of starting over)**

So how do you write a meaningful story? There is no short answer to that, but a good start is to think about your own experiences in life and important memories you have. Some memories may be sad, or you might remember something that taught you an important lesson. If you remember it vividly, this might be a good start for a story.
