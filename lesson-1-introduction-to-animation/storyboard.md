##Storytelling and Pre-production

###Storytelling

Think about your favorite animated movie. What was the movie about? What was the main character's name? How did that movie make you feel?

Chances are, if you have a favorite animated movie, you remember the story by heart, the character's names and what they are like (funny, grumpy, quirky, smart). Depending on the movie, you might know the lyrics of the songs the characters sing, and you definitely remember how that movie made you feel. You may get emotional just thinking about a sad scene, because you care about those characters and what they have gone through. That is why story is the most important aspect of an animation.

You may create the most technically stunning animation you are capable of, but if you don't have an interesting story behind it, it probably won't engage the viewer. Animation, as any other art form, needs to be imbued with meaning, even if this meaning is not instantly noticeable.

So how do you write a meaningful story? There is no short answer to that, but a good start is to think about **your own experiences in life and important memories you have**. Some memories may be sad, or you might remember something that taught you an important lesson. If you remember it vividly, this might be a good start for a story. Don't confuse this with the idea that every story you write is specifically about you. What you want to focus on is the feeling you get, the emotion you feel when you remember something, and **how you translate that feeling into a story**. Also very important is how you transfer that emotion to other people. Make sure your story is **relatable**, and that other people understand what you are trying to convey.

Try to **keep your story simple**, at least at first. Once you have a general idea of what your story is about, try to plan ahead and think how it all starts, and how it will end. This might help you to keep a clear goal and not get sidetracked. This doesn't mean that you can't change your mind though. **Stories change and evolve constantly** while you create them, so don't feel pressured to work on an idea just because it looked really good in the past, and don't be afraid of starting over.

Writing doesn't have to be a lonely process. Look for other people's opinions and pay attention to their reaction to your story. Take all criticism and praise into account, but make sure to stay true to your vision. Remember this is your story and you are free to tell it any way you like it.

Finally, as you write your story, try to imagine it as a movie/animation. Ask yourself how does it translate to the screen, what do the characters and locations look like, and how does that affect the story itself. This will make the process of turning your story into an animation later on much easier.

### Pre-production


Pre-production is the planning period before any development is done. It is in this phase that your ideas and animation take shape as you better define characters, locations, story and as many other details as you can. The first step of pre-production is called...

####Outline

The outline is a document where you collect and organize all the elements of your story. This is a very important step in animation development, and very useful to not lose sight of the details about the plot, characters, etc.

An outline can have many forms. It can be a simple list or a collection of reference images, text and even sounds. It depends on what works better for you as an animator.

The main elements of an outline are:

- **Story pitch or summarized plot:**

    A short version of your story with all of the most important plot points. It can be presented as a couple of short paragraphs, or even bullet points. Your story pitch should answer some of these questions:
    - Who is the main character and what are his/her objectives and motivations?
    - What is the character's initial condition, and how does that change over the course of the story?
    - What are the obstacles and conflicts the main character faces?
    
    
- **Character profiles:**

    Everything there is to know about the characters in your story. A few examples are:
    - Character's name
    - Age and/or date of birth
    - favorite food/color/type of music
    - Personality traits/general mood
    - Catchphrases
    - Anything else that may be essential to the plot (past traumas, goals in life, etc.)
    
    You should strive to create characters with opinions and feelings, and that also have consistency. Even if most of the details you list in this step end up not making into a scene in your animation, the fact that you thought about them will help you create more believable characters.
    
- **Locations:**

    A list of locations with detailed descriptions. In this section you can specify:
    - Where and when does your story happen (in a space station, in an arcade in the 1980's, inside a kitchen). Describe each landscape and scenery, or use pictures/illustrations as reference.
    - Overall mood of the place
    - Time of day/weather/season    
    - How does the location affects the characters
    
    Depending on your story, locations can be almost as important as a character, so make sure to think about your locations very carefully.
    
When you finish your outline, and even as you organize and write your outline, you'll notice that your story evolves and sometimes can even change completely. This is a common ocurrence, so don't be afraid of rewriting your story as many times as you feel is necessary.

Once you complete this step, you are ready to start working on the...

####Storyboard

Storyboards are a visual representation of your story. As the name suggests, it consists of a collection of illustrations or images, generally pinned to a board, showing your scenes in chronological order. Storyboards can be as detailed or as simple as you want, and you don't necessarily need to use an actual board, as even small thumbnails scribbled on paper should be fine, as long as that clearly conveys the ideas your story.

The storyboard is and incredibly useful tool, and it contains a lot of information about your animation, such as:

- "camera" movement and scene composition

    In a storyboard, you can define how a camera should be positioned, and also how it should move with the use of arrows inside or around the frame. Here are some examples:
>add examples

- scene cuts and action timing

    Because of the chronological nature of the storyboard, you can use it to easily define when things will happen in a scene, and when one scene will cut to the next.
    
- character posing and movement

    You can pose and even give the idea of movement to a character by using arrows close to or around it.
    >add examples

- scene by scene description

    You can write a short description of the scene under each frame of a storyboard. This helps to clarify any details that might be hard to convey in the frame.
    
Once the storyboard is in place, it serves as a guide for the entire production process, so it is important to take your time developing it and make sure that it is clear and easily understandable.

For pre-production:
You need a outline/show bible and a final draft script.

You need character, location and prop designs. Pose sheets of the same, plus turnarounds and expression sheets. Mouth charts are needed too if you have dialogue, this is for all speaking characters.
Locations would need at least two views, and props would need images showing their functions, if specific. You'd also need size comparisons as well.
Any special effects animation should have its styling designed at this point as well, so that layout can take its cues from the style.
You also need complete colour models/ colour guide done for all 4 categories. Digital colour will need precise colour chips or palette for painting the animation.
The idea is to idiot-proof the material so that anyone can understand what characters look like, how they generally move, what their general expressions and etotions are, what the settings are, and how props work and are used.

Voice track should be recorded at this point.

Then you need storyboards done for the entire 10 minutes.
Storyboards need all scenes numbered, re-used cited, camera directions shown and labelled, and dialogue labelled.

Then the 'board needs to be slugged (timed out per the entire show, and per scene), and then an animatic shot.
Then the slugging needs to be broken down into sheet timing for the exposure sheets--based on the voice track, and then layout of the individual scenes begun.
Layout must supply key poses and timing charts fo the animation, including any breakdowns of the secondary actions and major inbetweens. Also should have mouth charts and all major lip-synch posed out, so that animation should essentially just use the provided moths and poses.
Layouts can be medium rough-but a sample clean drawing should be provided in every scene to give animation an idea of the line quality called for.

While Layout is commencing, background painting should be undertaken.

This so that all the studio has to do is supply animation key poses, clean-up and in betweens--and whatever post-production services they agree to.
