# Unit 4

##Color Grading and Visual Effects

###Overview

Throughout this course you have learned the history and principles of animation, how they have evolved from traditional to digital mediums, and how to apply them using After Effect. You have learned and exercised the rules to create compelling stories and memorable characters, and you have learned to animate simple and complex shapes to show emotion, personality traits, and tell your story. Now it is time to apply the final touches to make your story really stand out. In this unit you will learn color grading, camera effects, and post-production in After Effects. You will then exercise these concepts in one of the scenes for your final project. At the end of this unit you will have learned to use color grading and camera effects to add interest to the scenes of your final animation.
