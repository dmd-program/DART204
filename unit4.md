# **ART 204 - Unit 4**

## Visual Effects

### **Overview**

**Character animation** is arguably one of the most complex parts of animation, and an entire course could be dedicated exclusively to this discipline. In this Unit we will see a few techniques to start creating our own animated characters, as well as understand concepts such as forward and inverse kinematics and character rigging.

Topics:
Effects, color correction, noise, vignette, depth of field, motion blur, 3D layers, camera animation

Lesson 7: Color correction and effects

Exercise 7: Hue and saturation, levels, blur, 3D layers and camera movement
Activity 7.1: Fix this scene - Match foreground and background element colors
Activity 7.2: Fix this scene - Use blur, vignette and camera movement to create depth in a scene
