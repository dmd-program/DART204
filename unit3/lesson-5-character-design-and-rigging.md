##Lesson 6: Character Design

In Lesson 1 you have learned the rules to create great stories and characters. In this lesson we will go deeper into the principles used by artists to design memorable characters. You will also learn how to create a character sheet, a fundamental tool used in the animation process.




Designing a great character is a prerequisite for the development of a striking and memorable story. A great character design goes beyond creating a character that is visually appealing or complex. You want to develop characters people can relate to, characters they imagine meeting some day and sharing their stories. 

Great characters invariably generate emotional responses from the viewers in the form of joy, sadness, compassion, and anger. You want people to feel something when they meet your character for the first time. You want them to root for your character and emotionally react when his/her journey come to an end.

Designing a great character takes time. It involves trying out different shapes, colors, pieces of clothing, facial expressions, movement (to name a few) in order to define features that bring its personality to life.
