##Character Sheet

The design and animation of a character invariably relies on the production of a character sheet. A character sheet, also known as a model sheet, is a page traditionally created to portray a character’s ‘turnaround’, depicting it from different views (usually front, back, side, and ¾ angle). The sheet is also usually used to show the character in different poses. It can contain the character’s entire body or focus on a single section, such as its head/face. The character sheet is a very useful tool for character design, and later during production, serving as a guide to keep the character consistent.

For an example of a traditional character sheet see:

Character sheets can also:

1. Present the inspiration for a character, describing where its shape(s) comes from. 

 For example, see the design for Heffer from Rocko’s Modern Life at http://www.traditionalanimation.com/wp-content/gallery/rockos-modern-life/HefferWolfe.gif

2. Show how a character relates to other characters in the animation in relation to size, shape, personality, etc.
	
 For example, see Powerpuff Girls’ size comparison character sheet at

3. Depict particular elements from a character that will inform the animation, describing how different parts of its body should behave and move, thus serving as a valuable reference during the animation process. 

 For example see the Powerpuff Girls’ DOs and DON’Ts character sheet at

The character sheet is particularly important in animation processes involving larger teams. It serves as a guide that multiple artists and animators can follow to assure the character is consistently portrayed in the various scenes of an animation.
