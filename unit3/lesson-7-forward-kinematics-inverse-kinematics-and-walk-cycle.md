### Lesson 7 - Character Animation

In the previous lesson you have designed the main character for your final project. You have also created a character sheet outlining its main features and how you envision its behaviour/movement in relation to its environment and other characters introduced in your story. In this lesson you will learn basic concepts for character animation, such as forward and inverse kinematics, and character rigging. You will also learn how to create a walk cycle. At the end of the unit, you will apply these concepts in two short animations that show your character moving and one depicting emotion/personality traits.

In this lesson we will use a plugin called **DUIK**. This plugin is free, and it is an indispensable tool for working with character animation in After effects.
