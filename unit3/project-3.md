##Project 3: Scene Test

In this project you will animate your character following one of the scenes from your storyboard. 
This is your first opportunity to test your character’s design and rigging as part of your final animation to make sure everything is working properly. It is also a chance to start developing the environment where your character’s journey will take place before you move into your final project. 

###Guidelines

Pick one scene from your storyboard (Project 1) and animate the character you have designed (Exercise 6.1) and rigged (Exercise 7.1) in Unit 3 accordingly. The idea is for you to use this animation in your final project, so make sure you pick a scene that is challenging. This is the time to find out if any elements from your character’s design and/or rigging are not working, and to see how your character fits within one of the scenes you have envisioned. This is an important step so you can make any necessary adjustments before your start working on the final project for this course.

###Steps to completion

1. Pick one of the scenes from your storyboard. Since this is the moment to test one of the scenes from your final animation, you might want to pick a scene where your character needs to move in particular ways you have not tried before. 

 Do you have any scenes where your character needs to run, dodge, or perform any complex movement? This is the time to try them out!

2. Following your storyboard (Project 1), use Illustrator/Photoshop to create additional assets for your scene. What elements do you need in order to create the place where the action is happening (do you need clouds, vegetation, built structures, animals)? 

 Take the time to start developing the background and other elements your character will interact with in the scene you have selected. This is the first opportunity you have to start building and testing your character’s journey, and it is a crucial step to improve your final animation.

3. Import all assets you have created into Adobe After Effects. Arrange all the elements and add your character into the scene.

4. Using After Effects, animate your character in the scene you have selected. Make sure to test the timing of your character’s movements and be attentive to how it fits with the other assets you have create. Does your character stand out?

5. Go back to your character's original design and rigging to make any changes necessary. Don’t be afraid to alter your original vision. It is only by testing things out that you will see what works and what doesn’t.

6. Take a closer look into your complete animation and make any necessary adjustments.

7. Export your final animation as an .mp4 video following this naming convention:

8. Upload the animation to your frame.io page and post the link on the course page.
