# Project 1 - Rube Goldberg

In this project you will design an animation based on **Rube Goldberg machines**.

Rube Goldberg was an American cartoonist and inventor that became famous for his depictions of contraptions that were composed of multiple steps to achieve a very simple task. His work was so popular that by the 1920's his name had become a reference for this kind of machine, and it is still used to define something that is overly complicated.

One of the earliest examples of his work is the Self-Operating Napkin:

Since then, Goldberg's work has influenced many different medias, such as music videos, movies, art and animation:
