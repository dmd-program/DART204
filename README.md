## **2D Animation Fundamentals**

### **Overview**

In Unit 1 we will talk about the fundamentals that apply to all kinds of animation, from hand drawn to computer generated. These fundamentals are the base to understand what animation is made of, and how it can bring even simple shapes like a rectangle or a circle to life. This unit will also give you an understanding of the differences between good and bad animation, so you can apply good practices to create more engaging and thoughtful animations of your own.
