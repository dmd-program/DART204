# **ART 204 - Unit 1**

## **2D Animation Fundamentals**

### **Overview**

In Unit 1 we will talk about the fundamentals that apply to all kinds of animation, from hand drawn to computer generated. These fundamentals are the base to understand what animation is made of, and how it can bring even simple shapes like a rectangle or a circle to life. This unit will also give you an understanding of the differences between good and bad animation, so you can apply good practices to create more engaging and thoughtful animations of your own.

### **Lesson 1 - Animation Principles 1**

In this lesson we will explore some of the basic animation principles, first devised by Disney animators in the 1930's, and finally outlined in the 1981 book "The Illusion of Life" by Ollie Johnston and Frank Thomas. Throughout animation history, these principles became the guiding rules to create more dynamic and believable animations. They have been adapted and applied to every kind of animated medium, starting with traditional hand drawn movies, all the way to stop motion and 3D. We will examine each of these principles with animated examples, and discuss how they can be applied in your own work. At the end of this lesson you will work on few simple animations through exercises that will be the foundation of every animated work you create from then on.

For this lesson we will look into 6 of the 12 animation principles:

1. Timing and Spacing

2. Ease in and Ease out

3. Straight Ahead and Pose to Pose

4. Squash and Stretch

5. Exaggeration

6. Arcs



**1. Timing and Spacing**

Timing and spacing are the base of every animated work. As animators, time is our main resource and constraint, and in animation we convey motion by placing \(or spacing\) images in time. By combining timing and spacing we create the illusion of movement.

Timing in animation is counted in frames, and most animations created for broadcast or film today utilize a rate of 24 frames per second, or fps. In traditional hand drawn animation, this means you need 24 drawings per second of animation. This rate has been passed down from the film production process in the 1920's, as it was the least amount of frames a film should have to create the illusion of fluid motion. Hand drawn animation started with much less fps, but once it became a mainstream medium it adopted the same standard set by film production.

Some animations created for TV, web or games can have different fps, like 30 or 60, because the process to create these animations is different from the traditional method. Because of this increased frame rate, they create a much smoother motion. As an example, imagine that to create a hand drawn animation at 60 instead of 24 fps, you would need to make 36 more drawings per second, so depending on how you create the animation, it can be a very time consuming process.



> **Curious fact:** Japanese hand-drawn animation, or anime, generally runs at 24 fps, but is animated at just 8 fps, meaning that each drawing stays on screen for 3 frames, which gives it a very unique style and movement.



To exemplify, letâ€™s think about the animation of a ball going from left to right. It takes the ball exactly one second to move from one side to the other, so our timing chart will look like this:
