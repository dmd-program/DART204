#### Audio and Timing

Audio is an important aspect of every kind of animation, but even more important for motion design. In motion design, audio can be the entire base for the animation and can dictate how and when all of the elements will move on screen.

Ideally, when working with motion design, you start with the audio track. This can be provided by a client, or it can be a song that you like, or a sentence from a movie. From that point, you sync your animation to the beats, instruments or words from the audio.

If you don’t have an audio track to work with, it is a little harder to create a rhythm for your animation, but as we did when we first animated our logo during Lesson 3, you can animate your elements based on a set time, making sure you preview it regularly so your animation doesn’t start dragging on.

When working with audio in After Effects it is a good idea to visualize the **waveform** of that audio so that you have a visual representation of your audio file, making the syncing process a little bit easier. To do that, expand your audio layer, then the Audio attribute, and finally the Waveform attribute. This is what you should see in your timeline:

You can have multiple audio layers for each animation, and you can control the volume of each layer independently by using the **Audio Levels** attribute.

Another common workflow to work with audio in After Effects is to make use of **Markers** to place visual cues of where your keyframes should be. In addition to that, you can keep the **Ctrl key** pressed when dragging your time indicator to hear a real time preview of your audio. By combining these techniques you will have a really solid visual guide of your audio track, and will be able to sync your audio and animation much more easily. Here is a quick introduction to these techniques for audio syncing in After Effects:
