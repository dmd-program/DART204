##Project 2 - Title Screen

For this project you will create a title sequence for the final animation you will develop for this course. A title sequence is much more than just a static screen where you show the name of your story. It gives you the opportunity to combine motion graphics and music to not only present the title of your story, but also to introduce and support its main ideas. Take another look at the title sequence for Monsters Inc. It not only introduces the title of the movie, but also the idea of monsters living behind bedroom doors. It is simple, yet creative, striking, and memorable.

###Guidelines

Using the concepts you have learned in lessons 4 and 5, and that you have practice in Exercises 4 and 5, and based on your short story (Exercise 2) and storyboard (Project 1), create a 5-10 seconds title sequence for you animation. 

Keep in mind, your title sequence doesn’t need to have a lot of elements. It should simply convey a clear message, introducing the main ideas of your animation by presenting a strong and clear concept, and/or evoking particular emotion(s).

###Steps to completion

1. Using your short story (Exercise 2) and storyboard (Project 1), create a title for your animation. Your title should preferably be short and clearly convey the main idea of your story. A way to approach the creation of your title is to list words that help you describe your character’s journey (for example your character’s name, the place where the story is taking place, what the journey is about). Then think which 1-4 words that best describe your story and try arranging them together to create a strong and compelling title. 

2. Which other elements besides words your title bring to your mind and would help to introduce your story? List these different elements and make sketches by hand, or using Illustrator/Photoshop, depicting how your title and these elements could come together as a “mini animation” to introduce your story. 
	
 This is also a good moment to choose the music you will use for your title sequence. Remember that a great open source option to look for music is the “Experimental” category in the Free Music Archive http://freemusicarchive.org/. If the music you selected is too long, think about ways to edit it, so your title sequence audio doesn’t end too abruptly.

3. The next step is to put your storyboard skills into practice. Create a storyboard for your title sequence. The storyboard should contain all frames needed so you can think through the different elements, transitions, and how they relate to the music you have selected to present your animation’s title. 

4. Create all different assets, including words and graphic elements, using Illustrator/Photoshop. Your title sequence should include the title of your animation, your name, and any other information you deem necessary and that can be presented in 5-10 seconds. Remember, each element that will be animated needs to be in a separate layer.

5. Import your assets into Adobe After Effects. If you don’t remember how to do this step, watch again the video available on Lesson 4.

6. Animate all your assets using After Effects. As in Exercises 4 and 5, test different speeds for your animation, syncing it with your selected music. Achieving a good result takes time, so allow yourself enough time to experiment and try different things out. 

7. Take a closer look into your complete animation and make any necessary adjustments.

8. Export your final animation as an .mp4 video following this naming convention:

 art204_project2_lastname_firstname.mp4

9. Upload the animation to your frame.io page and post the link on the course page.
