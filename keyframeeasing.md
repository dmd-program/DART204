#### Keyframe easing

This animation principle is the easiest to apply in After Effects, since it requires only a few clicks to activate, and not a lot of work to customize and tweak.
In After Effects, when you create a keyframe, that keyframe is automatically set as a **linear keyframe**, and it doesn’t contain any kind of easing.

This is what linear keyframes look like:

To change the transition of those keyframes from linear to ease, all you have to do is select the keyframes, click with the right mouse button, then select **Keyframe Assistant > Easy Ease**. Your keyframes now will look like this:

The great thing about ease keyframes in After Effects is that they can be applied to any animation property, position, scale, rotation and even opacity. Let’s take a look at how our animation changes just by converting all of our keyframes to ease (slowed down for easier comparison):

The difference is subtle, but the one on the right already looks better, and all we had to do was change one setting. Fos simple animations this would be enough, but we will go more in depth and really take control of our animation with the use of the **Graph Editor**.

The graph editor can be easily overlooked by beginner animators because it looks complicated and hard to use, but it is an essential tool that gives complete control over an animation.

Here is a quick overview of the graph editor in After Effects:

Now that you know how to ease in and out your keyframes and use the graph editor, you’re ready to customize your animations even further. Other animation principles like squash and stretch, follow through and overlapping action can also be applied to motion design, and we’ll take a closer look at these principles at the end of this lesson.
