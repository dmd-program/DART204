### Exercise 3

In this lesson we learned about the animation properties in After Effects, and how we can use these properties to create motion design elements.

For this exercise, your task is to think about yourself as a product or brand, and create a logo animation for your name/nickname. Think about the traits that define you and your brand, and list them in order to create a profile for your animation. Would your animation be energetic or elegant, minimalistic or detailed, slow or fast paced?

Make sure you follow the steps listed in this lesson, and to really highlight the traits you select for your profile.
