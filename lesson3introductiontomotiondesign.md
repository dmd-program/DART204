### Lesson 3 - Introduction to Motion Design

#### What is motion design?

Before we dig into the more specific elements of motion design, we need to understand what motion design is. **Motion design** (also known as motion graphics) is an entire category of animations, ranging from movie titles, to logo animations, typographic animations and infographics. Motion design is present in every media, and can be seen sometimes in very small and simple elements like an animated button on a website or an animated app interface. Put simply, motion design is **animated graphic design**.

#### How is motion design different from 2D animation?

A simple way to differentiate the two is by thinking about them in relation to characters. 2D animation focuses on characters, their personality and how their stories are developed. Motion design can have characters, but they are not the main focus of the animation. In motion design the focus is on timing and flow. If you’re new to motion design, these concepts may sound a little abstract, but don’t worry. Once we start analising some examples of motion design, all of these concepts will become very clear.

**Take the opening credits for TEDx Ningbo for example:**

**Or the Motion Awards Call for Entries of 2016:**

Notice how the shapes **flow** from one to the next seamlessly, and follow the timing of the sound effects and music. These are very good examples of how good graphic design can be elevated by motion design to deliver a clear and engaging message.
