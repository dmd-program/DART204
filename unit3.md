# **ART 204 - Unit 3**

## Introduction to Character Animation

### **Overview**

**Character animation** is arguably one of the most complex parts of animation, and an entire course could be dedicated exclusively to this discipline. In this Unit we will see a few techniques to start creating our own animated characters, as well as understand concepts such as forward and inverse kinematics and character rigging.

>Topics:
Simple character design and animation, object parenting, forward kinematics, inverse kinematics, puppet tool, Duik


Lesson 5: Rigging and Character Design

When we create a character to aniimate in After Effects, the first thing we need to do is think about how this character is going to move, and what actions is it going to perform. These actions will define what kind of **rigging** we will develop for this character. 
			
Rigging is the process of parenting or linking parts of the character to create a hierarchy. For example, we can parent the hand to the forearm, so when we move the forearm, the hand will follow. If we repeat that process between the forearm and the arm, we will create a hierarchy.

To parent one object to another in After Effects, all you need to do is click the pick whip icon and drag from the **child** layer, to the **parent** layer. The dropdown next to the pick whip will then show the name of the parent layer:
