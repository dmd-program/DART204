# Unit 3

## Introduction to Character Animation

### Overview

In the two previous units you have learned the principles of animation, how they have progressed with the move from traditional to digital techniques, and also how to apply them using After Effects. Now it is time to move on to one of  the most important elements of any animation: the characters. Character design and animation are arguably two of the most complex parts of the animation process, and an entire course could be dedicated exclusively to those. In this Unit we will discuss how to create a compelling and memorable character. We will also talk about techniques for character animation. You will design and animate the main character for your final project, which you have already outlined in Unit 1, and you will test it in one of the scenes for your final project. At the end of this unit, you will have learned the principles for character design and how to create a character sheet. You will also understand concepts such as forward and inverse kinematics and character rigging, and you will be able to animate a character walk cycle.
