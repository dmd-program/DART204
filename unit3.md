# **ART 204 - Unit 3**

## Introduction to Character Animation

### **Overview**

**Character animation** is arguably one of the most complex parts of animation, and an entire course could be dedicated exclusively to this discipline. In this Unit we will see a few techniques to start creating our own animated characters, as well as understand concepts such as forward and inverse kinematics and character rigging.

>Topics:
Simple character design and animation, object parenting, forward kinematics, inverse kinematics, puppet tool, Duik


Lesson 5: Rigging and Character Design

When we create a character to be animated in After Effects, we first need to think about how this character will move, and what actions it is going to perform. This will help us define what kind of **rigging** we will use for this character.
			
Rigging is the process of parenting or linking parts of a character to create a hierarchy. For example, we can parent the hand to the forearm, so when we move the forearm, the hand will follow. If we we do that again between the forearm and the arm, we will create a hierarchy. This process makes animating a character much more efficient and intuitive.

To parent one object to another in After Effects, all you need to do is click the pick whip icon and drag from the **child** layer, to the **parent** layer. The dropdown next to the pick whip will then show the name of the parent layer:

Another very important thing to keep in mind when parenting layers and rigging a character is the **anchor point** of your layers. The anchor point is what defines your layer's center of rotation. As an example, the center of rotation of an arm is the shoulder, while the center of rotation of the forearm is the elbow. For this reason it is very important to place the anchor points of your layers properly **before you start rigging**.
