##Digital Animation Process

### From traditional to digital

So far we've been looking at how animation was done traditionally, with hand-drawn illustrations done frame by frame, and the principles that guide this process to create the illusion of movement.

While some people may see traditional and digital animation as two different kinds of animation, the truth is that one is simply an evolution of the other. Both are based on the exact same principles, but digital animation uses computer programs to simplify some of its processes.

Some of these programs still try to replicate the hand-drawn, frame by frame experience, but most modern animation programs use a different approach that greatly speeds-up the animation process. One of these programs is Adobe After Effects, and this is what we will be using in this course.

2D animation is just one of the many capabilities of After Effects. For this reason the program can be a little bit overwhelming at first. Please watch [this introductory video](https://helpx.adobe.com/after-effects/how-to/aftereffects-workflow-terminology.html) to have a better sense of the software's interface and and general functionality before we can continue to our next exercises.

###Asset creation

Asset creation is the process of drawing your characters, props and environments. In traditional animation, different assets would be drawn in separate cels to be superimposed later. In digital animation, this process is generally done in illustration software such as Photoshop, Illustrator and even After Effects itself. You can start with an illustration that contains a complete scene, with characters, environment and props, but having each of these parts as a separate element makes it much more manageable later on.

Another very important part of the asset creation process is **separating each element in its own layer**. For example with a character, you'll need to have separate layers for the head, the torso, for different parts of each arm, for different parts of each leg, for each hand and each foot, and depending on the character, also for facial features that will be animated separately like the mouth and eyes. If this is not done properly you'll end up with a flat image that can't be animated at all.

###Importing Assets in After Effects

When you finish preparing your assets in Photoshop or Illustrator, you can start importing them in After Effects. Always check if your layers were properly imported so you don't have any problems in the future.

### Composition Settings

Each composition in After Effects has its own settings, so make sure to check if you have everything configured properly to avoid problems in the future.

The easiest way to ensure your settings are correct is to use the preset 'HDTV 1080 24'. This will set your resolution to HD and your frame rate to 24 frames per second.

### Exporting your animation

Once your animation is done, you'll need to render it to a video file. It is important to use the right settings so you won't end up with a pixelated looking video.

In this course we will work with these settings:

Video Format: H264 (.mp4)
Resolution: 1920x1080 pixels
Frames Rate (FPS): 24
Field Order: Progressive
Aspect: Square Pixels (1.0)
Profile: Main
Level: 4.1
Bitrate Encoding: VBR 1 pass
Target Bitrate: 5 Mbps
Max Bitrate: 6 Mbps
