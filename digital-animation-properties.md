##Digital Animation Process

### From traditional to digital

So far we've been looking at how animation was done traditionally, with hand-drawn illustrations done frame by frame, and the principles that guide this process to create the illusion of movement.

While some people may see traditional and digital animation as two different kinds of animation, the truth is that one is simply an evolution of the other. Both are based on the exact same principles, but digital animation uses computer programs to simplify some of its processes.

Some of these programs still try to replicate the hand-drawn, frame by frame experience, but most modern animation programs use a different approach that greatly speeds-up the animation process. One of these programs is Adobe After Effects, and this is what we will be using in this course.

2D animation is just one of the many capabilities of After Effects. For this reason the program can be a little bit overwhelming at first. Please watch [this introductory video](https://helpx.adobe.com/after-effects/how-to/aftereffects-workflow-terminology.html) to have a better sense of the software's interface and and general functionality before we can continue to our next exercises.

### Digital Animation Properties

Every animatable element in After Effects has a few base properties that will define its animation. The most important properties are **position, scale, rotation and opacity**.

Here is a quick example of these properties in After Effects:

+ **Position** defines where the element is on screen over time.
+ **Scale** defines the size of the element over time.
+ **Rotation** defines the degree of rotation of the element over time.
+ **Opacity** defines the transparency of the element over time.

A **mask** is not an animation property, but masks are very important and are used extensively in motion design. They are a little bit different because they need two elements to work: the animation element (in the example above, the cube) and the mask itself (the rectangle that animates over the cube).

These properties cover pretty much all of the animations we will create, and when coupled with masks, they consist of the core of digital animation and motion design.

### Keyframes

In traditional animation, we generally think in terms of frames and how they are defined by importance (keyframes, extremes and inbetweens). These concepts are also important in digital animation, but there is a shift in the way you work and understand them. For example, once you create keyframes for an element in After Effects, the software will automatically fill in the gaps with inbetweens. Most of the time, it is not necessary to worry about extremes and inbetweens at all because a lot of the work is done on the keyframes themselves, through speed and easing options.
