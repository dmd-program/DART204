##Color Grading

In the process of creating an animation, the artist has many opportunities to introduce color. Sometimes while creating characters, or refining environments, colorizing your illustrations can give a better idea of what that element represents in the story. While this may be a good idea early on as a way to create a better sense of each character's identity and the general mood of an environment, sometimes when putting these elements together they may have disparate color palettes, and their looks simply don't match well.

The simplest way to deal with this kind of situation is by using color grading, a process commonly used in film production. Color grading can be a very simple, or very involved process, depending on the desired result, and it is incredibly versatile. It can be used for brightness and saturation correction (sometimes referred to as color correction) or it can completely transform a scene, sometimes literally from day to night.

Color grading tools can be found in pretty much every major editing and animation software such as Adobe Premiere, Adobe After Effects, Nuke, Avid, Final Cut, etc. There are also specialized color grading programs such as DaVinci Resolve and Adobe Speedgrade. I our case, we will use the built-in color grading tools in After Effects, since they are very easy to use but also very powerful.
