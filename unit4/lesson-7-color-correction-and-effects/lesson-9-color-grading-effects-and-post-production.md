###Lesson 8 - Color grading, effects and post-production

In this lesson you will learn ways to enhance your final animation with the use of color grading and camera effects. First, we will discuss color grading techniques:

- Brightness and Contrast 
- Levels
- Color Balance
- Hue and Saturation
- Curves
- Lumetri Color

Second, you will learn about camera effects:

- Parallax
- Depth of Field
- Vignette

You will learn how to apply each of these tools using After Effects and you will then practice what you have learned using the scene you have developed in Project 3.
