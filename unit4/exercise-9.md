##Exercise 8 - Color grading and scene mood

In Lesson 8 you have learned how to use color grading to correct the color in a scene and to completely alter its mood, changing it literally from day to night. In this exercise you will apply what you have learned to the animated scene you have create for Project 3. Were the colors of the various elements you have created for your scene a bit off? Was the mood of the scene not exactly following what you envisioned in your storyboard? Now is the time to correct those.

###Guidelines

In this exercise you will use color grading to develop two distinct outputs for the scene you have created in Project 3:

1. Use color grading to correct the overall look of your scene. You must use at least 3 color grading tools you have learned in Lesson 8 (Brightness and Contrast; Levels; Color Balance; Hue and Saturation; Curves; Lumetri Color) to correct the color of your scene. 

2. Use color grading to create an ‘opposite scene’ to completely alter the time of the day your scene is taking place. If your original scene is happening during the day, you should create a version of it happening during the night (or vice-versa).

You will submit (1) the original Adobe After Effects file for your color graded scene and (2) one clip combining your color graded and ‘opposite scene’. Remember, your ‘opposite scene’ needs to be as carefully colored and well balanced as your original scene, so you will most likely need to change all color settings and use additional color grading tools you have learned in Lesson 8.

###Steps to completion

1. Open the scene you have created for Project 3 in Adobe After Effects.

2. Refer back to your short story (Exercise 2.2) and storyboard (Project 1). What is the overall mood you think your scene should have? Should the colors be happy and vibrant, or should they be sober and toned down? Color grading is more than making a scene look good. Think about how the overall look of your scene can help you telling your story.

    With that in mind, correct the overall look of you scene by applying at least 3 color grading tools you have learned in Lesson 8. You can choose from:

    - Brightness and Contrast
    - Levels
    - Color Balance
    - Hue and Saturation
    - Curves
    - Lumetri Color
    
 All tools were explained at length in Lesson 8, so refer back to it if you have any doubts.

3. Now that you are happy with the overall look of your scene, save another version of your file to create your ‘opposite scene’. If your original scene is happening during the day you should create a version of it happening during the night (or vice-versa) using the color grading tools you have learned.

 Remember, if you have elements in your scene that would only exist during the day (for example the sun), you might want to change them for night elements (for example a moon and stars).

 Keep in mind that creating a good ‘opposite scene’ will take as much time as creating your original one, so allow yourself time to try out different color grading tools and settings. 

4. Take a final closer look into both scenes and make any necessary adjustments.

5. Save your scenes separately as (add details) and combine them into one clip for submission.

6. For this exercise you will submit:

 - The After Effects file you created for color grading your original scene. Post your final color graded scene as (add details) to the course page following this naming convention:

 - The clip you have created with both original color graded scene and your opposite scene. Post your final clip as (add details) to the course page following this naming convention:
