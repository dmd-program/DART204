###Camera effects

In the moviemaking process, the camera is one of, if not the most important aspect. Everything in the development of a film revolves around what the camera sees, how it is positioned, if it is in movement or static, if it shows the point of view of a character or of an invisible spectator.

While it is natural to think about the camera in relation to film development, when thinking about animation it may not be such a direct concept, since 2D animation is developed either entirely on a computer, or hand drawn frame by frame. At this point in the course you probably already realized that when we develop an animation, **our mind is the camera**. When we imagine how a scene will play out, the camera is there, giving us a sense of the **composition** of that scene.

How we position our camera and how we stage a scene in animation is very important, but it is equally important to direct the viewer's gaze to the important areas of a scene. This brings us back all the way to the beginning of the course, where we learned about the principle of animation called **staging**. This principle revolves around the idea that animated elements should be well distributed over a scene, and over time, so the viewer knows where to look and the story doesn't get lost. This is a great starting point, but we can greatly enhance this process with **camera effects**. These effects can be used to make our scenes more dynamic, give our environment more depth, and also give a better direction to the viewer about what is the most important element on screen at any given time.

####Parallax

Parallax occurs when you have background elements further away from the camera, and foreground elements closer to the camera. When the camera moves, the elements that are further away move slower than elements that are up close, giving a 2D scene a sense of depth. The largest the distance between these elements, the more pronounced the effect is. The easiest way to apply parallax to a scene is to separate your elements in layers, and then animate them at different speeds.
