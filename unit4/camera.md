###Camera effects

In the moviemaking process, the camera is one of, if not the most important aspect. Everything in the development of a film revolves around what the camera sees, how it is positioned, if it is in movement or static, if it shows the point of view of a character or of an invisible spectator.

When we develop an animation, our mind is the camera. When we imagine how a scene will play out, the camera is there, giving us a sense of staging and composition.

When watching an animated movie, it may not be our first instinct to think about how the "camera" is positioned in a scene.
